# python-book-database
      
      For this project, I created a book "database" that allows the user to store information about books' info. There
      are three different primary operations which are creating books, querying the created books, and updating books. When
      books are created, the user is prompted to input a title, author, number of pages, current page, genre, and rating. 
      When querying the books, the user can search by title, author, genre, or rating. If there are any results from the search,
      they are printed and the main menu is shown below. Finally, to update a book you search by title, and then you are asked
      to input the information for the book, updating what you like.

      Please note that I created some sample books so that there are already books present for you to query and update. Additionally,
      in order for books to be saved the program has to be closed properly.
